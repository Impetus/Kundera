Overview
=========
The idea behind Kundera is to make working with NoSQL Databases drop-dead simple and fun. Kundera is being developed with following objectives:

* To make working with NoSQL as simple as working with SQL
*	To serve as JPA Compliant mapping solution for NoSQL Datastores.
*	To help developers, forget the complexity of NoSQL stores and focus on Domain Model.
*	To make switching across data-stores as easy as changing a configuration.
